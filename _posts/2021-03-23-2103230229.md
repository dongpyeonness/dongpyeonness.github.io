## Methods and Data {Methods}

$1 Per [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life_table](Wikipedia), this is "a table which shows, for each age, what the probability is that a person of that age will die before their next birthday [...] it represents the survivorship of people from a certain generation." It's a reference in the actuarial sciences to estimate prices of insurance products.

The main tool I'm going to be using to determine how long I will live is **actuarial tables**^1. There are several reasons I want to use this as a main reference:

* They're backed up by data: Insurance companies keep track of this stuff in order to make money. And they're doing pretty well, so they must be doing something right.
* They're available: The US government and various actuarial institutes make past data available to the public, and making it easy for me to use as well.
* They're backed up by reliability: Insurance companies have been making a profit off this data for a while now, so they have learned to do the statistics right.

Now I'm an applied math guy, and not a statistics guy, so I won't comment too heavily on the statistics. I can do some clever thinking about probability calculations, and that's about it. ==
